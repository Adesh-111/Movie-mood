## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v16 or later recommended)
- A [TMDb API Key](https://www.themoviedb.org/documentation/api)

### Installation

1. **Clone the repo:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/MovieMood.git
    cd MovieMood
    ```

2. **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3. **Set up TMDb API key:**

    Create a `.env` file in the root directory and add:

    ```
    VITE_API_KEY=your_tmdb_api_key_here
    ```

4. **Start the development server:**
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```
    The app will usually be available at [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173) (for Vite), or as configured.

- **MoviesArea/** ‚Äì The main movie browser and infinite scroll UI.
- **MovieDetailPage/** ‚Äì Movie detail with background trailer and info.
- **EmojiArea/** ‚Äì Mood/genre emoji picker.
- **ContextAPI.js** ‚Äì App-wide context and icons.
- **movieApi.js** ‚Äì TMDb API integration.

## How It Works

- Uses the [TMDb](https://www.themoviedb.org/) API for all movie, genre, and video data.
- Infinite scroll is implemented for both default and filtered/search views.
- YouTube trailers are displayed in the background using the YouTube IFrame API, with sound toggle (mute/unmute) that does **not** restart the video.
- Emoji genre picker updates the movie list based on mood.
- Filtering and sorting update the displayed movie list in real-time.

## Customization

- You can add/remove languages in `importantLanguages` in `MoviesArea.js`.
- To change emoji or genres: edit `EmojiArea.js`.
- To style the app, edit the CSS files in each component folder.

## Deployment

You can deploy MovieMood to Vercel, Netlify, or any static host. Just build with:

```bash
npm run build
```

and deploy the output in the `dist/` folder.
